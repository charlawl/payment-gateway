### Getting started

### To Do
- Logging 
  - Serilog would probably be the best choice here for simple logging
- Validation of card details
  - Checking credit card numbers match the type submitted
  - CVV numbers for different providers
  - Expiry date isn't in the past
- Full end-to-end acceptance tests
